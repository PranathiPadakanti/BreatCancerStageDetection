# BreatCancerStageDetection
Breast cancer is a prevalent and life-threatening disease that affects millions of women worldwide. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment and improved survival rates. This project focuses on leveraging data analytics techniques to enhance breast cancer detection and diagnosis. The proposed methodology integrates a multi-faceted approach, incorporating statistical analysis, and data visualization to extract meaningful insights from dataset.

The project begins with the collection of comprehensive breast cancer datasets, encompassing clinical and imaging information. Preprocessing techniques are applied to clean and standardize the data, ensuring its suitability for analysis. Data Analytic approaches are employed to identify the most relevant variables, reducing dimensionality and enhancing the accuracy of the subsequent models.
#Logistic Regression
This type of statistical model (also known as logit model) is often used for classification and predictive analytics. Logistic regression estimates the probability of an event occurring, such as voted or didn’t vote, based on a given dataset of independent variables. Since the outcome is a probability, the dependent variable is bounded between 0 and 1. In logistic regression, a logit transformation is applied on the odds—that is, the probability of success divided by the probability of failure
#1.2	Random Forest Classifier
Random Forest is a classifier that contains a number of decision trees on various subsets of the given dataset and takes the average to improve the predictive accuracy of that dataset.

#Conclusion 
After building the model for the Breast Cancer Detection with the help of the mentioned parameters of the dataset, we could conclude that
62.7% of the patients are detected as Beginning Stage
37.3% of the patients are detected as Metastasis Stage
